## About
A simple page to demonstrate my implementation of seamless infinite scroll functionality akin to social media apps. The images are fetched from the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/documentation) and we're tracking the moment all the images are loaded in order to dynamically hide the loading animation.
